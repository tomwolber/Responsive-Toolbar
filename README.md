**About:**

Responsive Toolbar is a (currently) small piece of pure JavaScript that displays the 
current window size, and what devices are associated with that size on an overlay on the
top of the page.

The Toolbar currently displays the size of the browser, and the devices that support that size.

I am open to suggestions for anything else that would be helpful.

This is in VERY EARLY STAGES of development.

**Working Demo:**

**Usage:**

Just add the JS file to your HTML:
```html
<script src="responsive_toolbar.js"></script>
```
