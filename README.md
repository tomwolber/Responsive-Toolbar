**About:**

Responsive Toolbar is a (currently) small piece of pure JavaScript that displays the 
current window size, and what devices are associated with that size on an overlay on the
top of the page.

This is in VERY EARLY STAGES of development.

**Working Demo:**

**Usage:**

Just add the JS file to your HTML.
