**About:**

Responsive Toolbar is a (currently) small piece of pure JavaScript that displays the 
current window size, and what devices are associated with that size on an overlay on the
top of the page. Responsive Toolbar currently uses the device sizes defined in the media 
queries found in Twitter Bootstrap. 

I am open to suggestions for anything else that would be helpful.

This is in VERY EARLY STAGES of development.

**Working Demo:**
